## Hi! I'm Lito

I'm a programmer and writer.

Here are some things I've worked on:
- For Oso's [Authorization Academy](https://www.osohq.com/academy), I worked with academic specialists in authorization to bring their domain knowledge to wider audiences. I'd think that between their knowledge and my writing, we made something both comprehensive and accessible! We got very good reviews on hackernews :)
- Also at Oso, I ran an interview series with noted developers, like this interview with [Charity Majors of Honeycomb](https://www.osohq.com/post/developer-den-with-charity-majors).
- I worked with Gary Bernhardt (of [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) fame) on [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/), an interactive set of programming lessons for professional programmers.
- I've helped new programmers learn engineering topics as a TA and guest speaker at the [Ada Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) in Seattle, WA.
- I've produced screencasts about unusual topics in computers (like [re-writing BSD 4.4 shell commands from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCuzvy79WWQ), or about how QuickCheck works). These had a small (very small, I mean really small, I should say) but loyal following.
- I've been lucky enough to get to give talks to very technical audiences at conferences, like at [!!con (how Nintendo GameBoy copy protection works)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkABpp-YL1I), StrangeLoop (about how Git works on a byte-by-byte level), and RubyConf (about how computers handle color).
