## Hi! I'm Lito

I'm a programmer and writer.

Here are some things I've worked on:
- My blog, [About Computers](https://litonico.github.io/about-computers/)
- For Oso's [Authorization Academy](https://www.osohq.com/academy), I worked with academic specialists in authorization to bring their domain knowledge to wider audiences. I think that between their knowledge and my writing, we made something both comprehensive and accessible! We got very good reviews on hackernews :)
- I've written technical documentation for [Oso](https://www.osohq.com/docs/tutorials/quickstart), nontechnical documentation for [Tuple](https://docs.tuple.app/article/34-preferences-general
), and product guides for [Moment](https://docs.moment.dev/moment-docs).
- Also at Oso, I ran an interview series with noted developers, like this interview with [Charity Majors of Honeycomb](https://www.osohq.com/post/developer-den-with-charity-majors).
- I worked with Gary Bernhardt (of [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) fame) on [Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/), an interactive set of programming lessons for professional programmers. There, I wrote lessons for experienced developers, like [this lesson](https://www.executeprogram.com/courses/everyday-typescript/lessons/as-is-dangerous) on the dangers of TypeScript's `as` keyword.
- For Destroy All Software, I co-produced and edited a video series on writing core computer tools from scratch, like this lesson on [writing a compiler from scratch](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch).
- For the great Seattle tech conference Deconstruct, I selected [speakers](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2019/dan-luu-files) and wrote content marketing blog posts, like planning and later editing this post on [motivating examples in talks](https://www.deconstructconf.com/blog/motivating-examples-in-talks).
- I've helped new programmers learn engineering topics as a TA and guest speaker at the [Ada Academy](https://adadevelopersacademy.org/) in Seattle, WA.
- I've produced screencasts about unusual topics in computers (like [re-writing BSD 4.4 shell commands from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCuzvy79WWQ), or about how QuickCheck works). These had a small but loyal following.
- I've been lucky enough to get to give talks to very technical audiences at conferences, like at [!!con (how Nintendo GameBoy copy protection works)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkABpp-YL1I), StrangeLoop (about how Git works on a byte-by-byte level), and RubyConf (about how computers handle color).
